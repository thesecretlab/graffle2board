graffle2board
===========

graffle2board is a Ruby script that uses the Scripting Bridge to generate a JSON file that describes an OmniGraffle document's nondirectional graph. We use it for generating levels for games.

To learn what it can be used for, and how to use it, check out the [blog post](http://blog.secretlab.com.au/2012/06/29/graffle2board/ "graffle2board on Secret Lab's blog").

graffle2board is inspired by [Michael Bianco's 'graffle2json.rb'](https://gist.github.com/1487305/2988ae1b0cc74afd78589b0cce9054259cbba876)
